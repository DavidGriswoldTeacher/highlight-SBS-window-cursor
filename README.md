This script was modified from https://github.com/yunyi-the-coder/mouse-cursor-highlight-windows

It is used to make a mouse cursor that will show up correctly in fullscreen Side by Side 3D apps

It works fine as long as you are using your app in fullscreen. run "Start.ahk" in AutoHotKey to make it start.
